Dang that's Delicious TO DO, additionally:

- make geolocation dynamic

- look at flash messages: not always working properly
>> case: Review model
e.g. when you submit a review without writing any text, no flash messages appears > the page just hangs
!! check indentation on Store.js (did anything get moved accidentally?)

- add regex to search function in case someone makes a typo / spells something differently

- put pagination interface parts (Prev, text, Next etc.) on one line (instead of above each other)
